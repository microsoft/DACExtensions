When adding new test scripts (source files and baselines), you must ensure that you set the "Copy to Output Directory"
property to "Copy Always". Otherwise they won't be found in the expected location when running our tests.
To set this property, right-click on the file in Solution Explorer and choose "Properties". The options for the file will be
visible in the Properties window once you do this.
